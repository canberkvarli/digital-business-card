        <p>
          As a passionate software engineer, I am on a mission to turn
          innovative ideas into exceptional web applications as well as testing
          out the waters of mobile development and the blockchain concept. With
          a solid background in Ruby, JavaScript, React/Redux, Python, Ruby on
          Rails, Flask, PostgreSQL, Node.js, Solidity, Hardhat, Mongoose,
          Express.js, and MongoDB, I thrive in the dynamic realm of technology.
        </p>

        <h1>Interest</h1>
        <p>
          Beyond the world of coding, you'll find me scaling rock walls, hitting
          the pavement for a run, catching waves while surfing, and diving deep
          into philosophical musings. I believe in the power of combining
          creativity with technical expertise to craft digital solutions that
          not only work seamlessly but also inspire. Let's connect and explore
          the intersection of technology and creativity!`
